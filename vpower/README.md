# Shifts Challenge

This repo contains code regarding the Ship Power Consumption track of the Shifts Challenge.

### Objective

The Ship Power Consumption track of Shifts Challenge aims to provide two datasets, a real "in-the-wild" dataset and its 
synthetic counterpart, regarding the maritime industry to assessing methods of robustness to distributional shift and 
uncertainty estimation. This is a scalar regression task that involves predicting the power consumption of a merchant 
vessel for various operational conditions. 

The dataset, referred as **_real dataset_**, contains operational data from sensors and weather providers in
per minute frequency. Furthermore, a second dataset, named **_synthetic dataset_**, is provided. This dataset is 
created by combining the real samples with synthetic power labels generated by a generative analytical 
physics-based model.

### Dataset Overview

The data are released under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode) license.
All data are provided as csv files.

Provided datasets are:

* Real dataset: `train.csv`, `dev_in.csv` and `dev_out.csv`
* Synthetic dataset: `train.csv`, `dev_in.csv` and `dev_out.csv`
