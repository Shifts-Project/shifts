# Shifts Challenge

This repository contains data readers and examples for the different datasets provided by the [Shifts Project](https://shifts.ai). 

The Shifts Dataset contains curated and labeled examples of real, 'in-the-wild' distributional shifts across three large-scale tasks. Specifically, it contains white matter multiple sclerosis lesions segmentation and vessel power estimation tasks' data currently used in [Shifts Challenge 2022](https://shifts.grand-challenge.org/), as well as tabular weather prediction, machine translation, and vehicle motion prediction tasks' data used in Shifts Challenge 2021. Dataset shift is ubiquitous in all of these tasks and modalities. 

The dataset, assessment metrics and benchmark results are detailed in our associated papers:

* [Shifts 2.0: Extending The Dataset of Real Distributional Shifts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.15407) (2022)
* [Shifts: A Dataset of Real Distributional Shift Across Multiple Large-Scale Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07455.pdf) (2021)

### Weather Prediction

The Shifts Weather Prediction Dataset  is released under [CC BY NC SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode) license. This dataset was constructed by combining features from publicly available weather prediction services and models. Specifically, we combined data from [NOAA/NWS servers](https://www.weather.gov/disclaimer), data generated by WRF model from [NCAR/UCAR](https://github.com/wrf-model/WRF/blob/master/LICENSE.txt),  and data from [Meteorological Service of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/transparency/terms.html).  Ground station readings were taken from [NOAA] (https://www.weather.gov/disclaimer). The data was cleaned and features standardized.
